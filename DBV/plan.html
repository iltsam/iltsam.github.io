<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>The goal is to improve the business by attracting a younger audience. This will be achieved by creating a website that is aimed at Young Adults and High School students.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The success of this website will be evaluated by comparing the amount of younger members joining before the website to the amount of younger members joining afterwards. </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience for this website is High School students and Young Adults. To design for this demographic I will be using some
basic guidelines:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Keeping a clean UI</li>
      <li>Breaking up textual content - No walls of text</li>
      <li>Keeping the content simple, but not to simple, they are not children.</li>
  </ul>
